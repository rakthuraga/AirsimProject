        "question": "is the jackson and smith building closer to me or the wheelchair signs on the floor (remember as much detail as possible)?",
        "response": "In the images provided, the Jackson & Smith building appears to be closer to the camera than the wheelchair signs on the floor. Here are the observations for detail:\n\n1. **Top Row**: \n   - Both images show a perspective that makes it evident that the camera angle is nearer to the Jackson & Smith building entrance. The wheelchair signs are further into the parking lot.\n\n2. **Middle Row**: \n   - Both images provide a top-down view of the crossing area in front of the Jackson & Smith building, reinforcing the proximity of the building to the camera compared to the wheelchair signs.\n\n3. **Bottom Row**: \n   - Although these images display a broader view of the parking lot, the Jackson & Smith building remains prominent and appears closer to the viewer, while the wheelchair signs are farther away.\n\nOverall, the Jackson & Smith building is consistently shown as being closer to the camera or viewer than the wheelchair signs on the floor."
